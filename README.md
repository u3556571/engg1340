</pre>

## Stage 1
  
**Problem Setting**  
  
A good mangaing system is helpful to a restaurants to manage some of the job such as occupancy, reservation, billing of their tables etc. This can reduce the manpower needed to handle some systematic job and avoid making man-made mistakes.  
  
In this project, we manage to build a system including the function below :
  
**The staff can:**  
  
1. Check the current occupancy and the reservation condition in the coming week of each table.
2. Check what food each table has ordered and corresponding arrival status.
3. Check how much each table has to pay and whether they have checked the bill or not.
4. Get notified when a table is ocuppied too long without checking the bill.
5. Change the setting of the system such as the amount of table or the table size.
  
**The customers can:**  
  
1. Request a table for now or to wait in the queue if there is not empty table currently.
2. Check what is their position in the waiting queue, and the estimated time for them to get a table.
3. Check what food they have ordered and corresponding arrival status.
4. Check how much they need to pay for the bill.
5. Check the current occupancy and the reservation condition in the coming week of each table.
6. Reserve tables in the coming week providing their surname, time, number of people, and their phone number.
7. Cancel the reservation by providing the reservation time and their phone number. 

**The system will:**  
  
1. Turn the reserved table back into empty condition, if the customer hasn't shown up for a certain time after the reservation time.
2. Notify the staff when a table is ocuppied too long without checking the bill.
