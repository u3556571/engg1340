</pre>

## Stage 1
  
#### Problem setting  
A good mangaing system is helpful to a restaurants to manage some of the job such as occupancy, reservation, billing of their tables etc. This can reduce the manpower needed to handle some systematic job and avoid making man-made mistakes.  
  
In this project, we manage to build a system including the function below :

1. The system will record the current occupancy and the reservation condition in the coming week and customer can check for these information at anytime.
2. The customer can reserve the table by providing the time, number of people, surname, and phone number.
3. The customer can cancel the reservation by providing the surname and phone number.
4. If the customer hasn't shown up 10 min after the time stated, the reserved table will turn back into empty condition.
5. The system can send waiting chits to customers and record their position in the queue. Customer can check their position at anytime.
6. The system will notify the staff when a table is ocuppied too long without new ordering.
7. The owner can change the setting of the system such as the table numbers and the table size.
